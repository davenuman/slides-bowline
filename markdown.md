# Developer Experience
### UX for DevOps?

???
We talk a lot about UX in our field. I want to talk about Developer Experience.

Example: woodworking hobby.

"It's not about the tools"
 -- (often said in DevOps)

| Powerful | Elegant |
|:---------|:--------|
| ![planer](images/powerplaner.jpg) | ![plane](images/handplane.jpg)  |

 ...but the tools are important.


???
The tools we use shape our developer experience.
When I use a hand plane, I love the experience.
It engages all my senses. keep developing a skill. Ready to use, no set up.
But not just tools, attitude - frame of mind, culture.

So, what might be involved in a positive DX?

---
# A Positive Developer Experience

 - Minimal Ramp up time
 - Context switching
 - Learnable patterns
 - Mastery

???
 - Bullets kill.

---
## Motivation

> We desire a consistent system that provides rapid sandbox set up,
> with flexibility for old and new Drupal projects
> and can contain project specific infrastructure.

> ...and also be used on ci server in the same way for testing.

#Introducing Bowline

![knot](images/320px-Palstek_innen.jpg)

Bowline is a set of (hopefully) simple tools focussed on easing docker set up and collating project things.

???
Mostly bash

- Bowline objectives:
 - minimize requirements (just needs docker 1.3+)
 - containerize as much as possible
 - hackability

---
`. bin/activate`

```bash
[ "$(alias | grep deactivate)" ] && deactivate  # In case already activated.
GIT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
alias deactivate="export PATH=$PATH; export PS1=\"$PS1\"; unset BOWLINE"
export PATH=$GIT_ROOT/bin:$PATH
export BOWLINE=${GIT_ROOT##*/}

if [ "$SHELL_TYPE" = "bash" ];then
  export PS1="${PS1}\[\033[01;31m\](${BOWLINE})\[\033[00m\] \$ "
else
  export PS1="${PS1} (${BOWLINE}) \$ "
fi
```

???
This is really important... when activated, new commands are available in your current shell environment. Some of those override commands you may already have such as drush, composer

---
## Bowline activated

```bash
Available commands:
activate  bowline  composer  fix-perms  invoke_proxy  settings_init
backup    build    drush     import     run

Containers:
db   ~  172.17.0.61
web  ~  172.17.0.62  http://172.17.0.62/
Proxy:
	http://bowline.localtest.me/
```

???
Yes, it works with D8.

---
## Hoist

```bash
~/workspace/bowline (bowline) Â» hoist
Usage: hoist [rigging]
Available riggings:
behat  drupal-core-dev
```

---

## bin/run (Simplified)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

source $(dirname $0)/../lib/bowline/bowline
enter_container

# Check Drush.
cd docroot
../vendor/bin/drush st
cd ..

# Behat tests
./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/behat/local.yml
```

---
## bin/run (Simplified) with migration

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

source $(dirname $0)/../lib/bowline/bowline
enter_container

# Behat tests
./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/behat/local.yml

# Run Migration
cd docroot
../vendor/bin/drush migrate-deregister --orphans
../vendor/bin/drush migrate-register
../vendor/bin/drush migrate-import --group=globalnet --limit=$LIMIT --force
../vendor/bin/drush migrate-status
```

---
## General Issues to solve

- Performance in boot2docker
- Incomplete set of tools
